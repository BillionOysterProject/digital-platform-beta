        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong>
            BOP is a restoration, education, and citizen science initiative that engages residents of the region in growing small populations of oysters and environmental monitoring at permitted waterfront sites around the New York Harbor. 
            The goal of the program is to increase the overall breeding population of native oysters in the Harbor and to engage young people and adults in active stewardship and citizen science.
            By adopting a BOP Oyster Restoration Station (ORS), participants agree to conduct monthly visits at their site using standard procedures and datasets covering oyster growth and mortality, basic water quality parameters, and marine ecology observations. 
            In this way, the project will eventually result in a comparative dataset on ecological health, viability of oyster restoration, and water quality at 28 sites across New York Harbor.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Common name of animal:</strong> Eastern oyster (<em>Crassostrea virginica</em>)</p>

        <p><strong>Source of oysters:</strong>
            All ORS were stocked with spat-on-shell oysters produced by New York Harbor Schoolâ€™s oyster hatchery and remote setting facility located on Governors Island. Harbor School oysters are grown from a mix of wild broodstock (Bronx River) and aquaculture stock (from Fishers Island and Muscongus Bay). Collection and importation of these broodstocks have been permitted under separate Shellfish Importation Permits and NYHS Marine Hatchery Permits # 65-P, 2017 and # 65-P, 2018. 
            Prior to adoption and installation of their ORS, all prospective participants attended a one-day training on Governors Island on how to stock, install, and monitor their ORS. Upon successful completion of the training, participants signed a contract, stocked their cage with  New York Harbor School oysters, and transported the cage to a designated and permitted waterfront site for installation.
