                <p>
                    Billion Oyster Project's mission is to restore oyster reefs to New York Harbor through public education initiatives.
                    Our vision is a future in which New York Harbor is the center of a rich, diverse, and abundant estuary. 
                    The communities that surround this complex ecosystem have helped construct it, and in return benefit from it, with endless opportunities for work, education, and recreation. 
                    The harbor is a world-class public space, well used and well cared forâ€”our Commons..
